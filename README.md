# CommanderBot

## What is this for?
Commander bot is a free Discord bot built to help players of the game "New World" at war management.

Since the game itself had poor usability in this aspect, I built Commander bot to help players visualize who wants to enlist in the war, their classes, levels and other relevant information

With this bot, people from your discord server can show interest in participating at the war you create.
This may be very helpful when the guild leader accepts/rejects players in-game.
